# Intro
Hello, I'm trying to learn x86 assembly stuff, so this is the repo for it.

# System
Its made for Windows using the Win32 library, so (this is a shocker) it wont work on Mac and Linux.

# Compiling / Running
I've created a windows batch file to
1. Assemble it
2. Link it
3. Debug it

## Invoking it
```
./run
```

# Requirements
It requires [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/), [msys2 (mingw)](https://www.msys2.org/), and [gdb](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) (comes in mingw)
